"""
    Issues the keys of the response engine for a client: one per worker (ADR-0022), six in all. For each worker it
    makes a new private key, keeps it in Andvari, where only that worker reads it, and registers its public part
    with the management API as the operator. The private keys are never printed nor written to disk.

        python -m ops.engine_keys <client id>

    Run it again whenever it stops halfway: a worker whose key is kept and registered is left as it is, one whose
    key is kept but not registered gets it registered, and only a worker with no key gets a new one. A kept key is
    never written over. It prints, for each worker, the kid and what was done.

    It reads its settings from the environment (or config.env):

        GATEWAY_URL                 the management API, e.g. http://gestion:5002
        GATEWAY_AUDIENCE            what tokens for that API carry in their aud
        GATEWAY_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE    the gateway's public keys, as {"keys": [...]}: what GET /gateway/keys gives
        OPERATOR_KEY_FILE           the operator's private signing key
        OPERATOR_CLIENT_ID          the operator's client id
        ANDVARI_ADDR, ANDVARI_CA_FILE
        ENGINE_KEYS_ROLE_ID         the AppRole of this command in Andvari, `motor-claves`
        ENGINE_KEYS_SECRET_ID_FILE  the file with its secret id
