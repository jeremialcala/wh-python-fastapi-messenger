TITLE = "Facebook Messenger Webhook Manager"

SUMMARY = "Controls the Facebook Messenger Lifecycle"

TERMS = "https://web-ones.com/terms"

DESCRIPTION = """
The management API of the gateway between Meta (Messenger and WhatsApp) and the response engine of each chatbot.
Each client manages its own chatbots through it and reaches nothing of anybody else's. What Meta calls is another
service, the webhook, which runs apart from this one.

Every route but the health check asks for a token in `Authorization: Bearer`: a JWT signed by the caller inside a
JWE encrypted to the gateway, valid once and for 60 seconds at most.

### A client and its chatbots

* /bot: @POST creates a chatbot.
* /bot/{bot_id}: @DELETE deletes it with everything stored for it.
* /chat/{bot_id}/info: @GET what is stored of the chatbot, and which Meta credentials are loaded.
* /chat/{bot_id}/credentials: @PUT loads or rotates its Meta credentials. They are never returned.
* /chat/{bot_id}/phones: @POST adds a WhatsApp number, @GET lists them. `?environment=` gives the last one of it.
* /chat/{bot_id}/rules: @POST adds rules, @GET builds the system prompt from them.
* /chat/{bot_id}/intents: @POST and @GET; /chat/{bot_id}/intents/{intent_id} takes @GET, @PUT and @DELETE.
* /chat/{bot_id}/tools: @GET the actions of its intents as tool definitions for the model.
* /chat/{bot_id}/contacts: @GET who wrote to it, a page at a time; /chat/{bot_id}/contacts/{contact_id} exports
  one with @GET and deletes it with @DELETE.
* /contacts/search: @POST finds a person in every chatbot of the client, by number or by Messenger id.
* /keys: @GET the keys of the caller, @POST adds one to rotate; /keys/{kid} removes one with @DELETE.

### The response engine

Each worker of the engine holds its own key for each client, and the key says which routes it reaches: the
notifier, the Meta tokens; the coordinator, the rules, the tools and the last turns of a conversation; the
classifier, the responder and the evaluator, the rules; the link, the tools. All of them read /gateway/keys.

* /chat/{bot_id}/tokens: @GET the Meta tokens of a chatbot. Only for the notifier, with the key it holds for the
  client that owns the chatbot.
* /chat/{bot_id}/contacts/{contact_id}/turns: @GET the last 10 turns of a conversation, for the coordinator.

### The operator

* /clients: @POST registers a client, @GET lists them; /clients/{client_id} takes one off with @DELETE.
* /clients/{client_id}/keys: the keys a client signs with; /clients/{client_id}/service-keys, the keys each
  worker of the response engine signs with for that client, with the worker that signs with each.

### Any caller

* /gateway/keys: @GET the audience and the public keys tokens are encrypted to.
* /health: @GET liveness, without a token.
"""

WEBHOOK_DESCRIPTION = """
What Meta calls for each chatbot. It checks that a notification comes from Meta, finds or stores who wrote, and
queues each message for the response engine. It runs apart from the management API and serves nothing else.

* /chat/{bot_id}: what Meta calls for a chatbot.
    * @GET: the verification challenge, checked against the verification token of the chatbot.
    * @POST: a notification, taken only with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256`. Each message in it is queued.
* /health: @GET liveness.
