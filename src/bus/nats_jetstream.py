"""
    The event publisher on NATS JetStream (ADR-0019): one connection per process, kept open and reconnected by the
    client, instead of one connection per message as with RabbitMQ. Each event goes with Nats-Msg-Id, so that the
    stream drops a second copy published within its window, and the publisher waits for the stream's acknowledgement
    (PubAck): Bifröst writes to disk before it gives one.
