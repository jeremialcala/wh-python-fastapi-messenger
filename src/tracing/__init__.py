"""
    Traces (OpenTelemetry, R4, RNF09): each message can be followed from the webhook to the ingestion and on to the
    engine, through the W3C context (`traceparent`) every event carries. Spans follow the rule of the logs (RS19):
    no number, no text of a message, nothing the caller sent. That is why nothing here instruments a library on its
    own, and why a span only takes the attributes of ALLOWED, each with a value of the shape it expects. Anything
    else is dropped, and the log says which key, never its value.

    Exceptions are never recorded on a span: their text can carry anything. A span that fails says the kind of
    failure in `error.type`, as the logs do.

    Without OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT spans are made but never leave the process: the context still goes on with
    each event, for whoever traces downstream.
