"""
    The ingestion of a notification (ADR-0021): what the webhook used to do before answering Meta, now done after,
    by the ingestion worker (ingest.py), from the event the webhook published on WEBHOOK. For each message of the
    notification, in order:

        1. it is skipped if it is already in the history: Meta sent it again;
        2. the contact is found, or stored, as before, asking the Graph API in Messenger;
        3. the message identified is published on its conversation's partition of MENSAJES, and the envelope of
           version 1 goes to the queue `llm` of Hermod, for the response engine that still reads it;
        4. the message is stored in the history.

    Publishing goes before storing: if the worker stops in between, the event is delivered again and the message
    published again, and the bus drops the second copy by Nats-Msg-Id. The other way round, a message stored but
    never published would be skipped on the next delivery and lost. The engine has to bear a duplicate anyway.

    Without a bus (development and the tests) the webhook runs this itself, on the event it would have published.
