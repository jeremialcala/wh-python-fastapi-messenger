    The people who wrote to a client's chatbots, for the client to answer them when they ask for their data:
    listing them, finding one by number, handing over everything stored about one, and deleting it. Deleting a
    chatbot is here too: it takes its contacts with it.

    Nothing here writes a name, a number or a Messenger id to the log: only the ids the service made up.
