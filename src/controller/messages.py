    What the webhook does with a signed notification it understood (ADR-0021). With the bus, it only publishes the
    notification as one event and Meta is answered once Bifröst keeps it: who wrote, the history and the queue of
    the response engine are the ingestion worker's (ingestion.py). Without a bus, which only development and the
    tests have, it ingests the same event itself before answering.
