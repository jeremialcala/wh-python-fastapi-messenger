"""
    The notices of erasure (ADR-0017, RF15): once the management API deletes a contact, a chatbot or a client, it says
    so on SUPRESIONES, so that the engine's coordinator deletes the context it keeps of them in Bifröst. One Supresion
    of asyncapi-v2.yaml per thing deleted, with identifiers only.

    A notice the bus does not take does not undo the deletion nor make it fail: the context it was about expires by
    itself 24 hours after its last message. It is left in the log.
