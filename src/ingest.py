"""
    The ingestion worker. It serves no route, and reads two streams of Bifröst, each with its own durable consumer,
    one event after another (controller/ingestion.py):

        * WEBHOOK, with `ingesta`: the notifications the webhook published (ADR-0021). Each message is identified,
          published for the engine and stored in the history.
        * RESPUESTAS, with `historial`: what the engine's notifier sent and Meta accepted (ADR-0017). Each answer is
          stored in the history.

        python ingest.py

    Each event is acknowledged once it is done. One that has to wait (the database, Andvari, Bifröst or Hermod are
    not there) is not acknowledged: Bifröst delivers it again after the consumer's backoff, 30 s, 1 min, 5 min... for
    as long as the stream keeps it. One that can never be ingested is dropped.

    It is alive while it touches ALIVE_FILE: the container's health check looks at how old that file is.
