"""
    Makes again the deletions written down in the register of erasures. It is what has to run after a backup of
    the database is restored: the backup brings back every contact, chatbot and client deleted after it was
    taken (ADR-0014).

    It goes through the whole register, oldest first. A deletion whose data is not there is left alone, so
    running it on a database that was not restored, or running it twice, changes nothing. Nothing it deletes is
    written down again.

    It only reports what it would do unless it is called with --apply.

        python -m migrations.replay_erasures            # report
        python -m migrations.replay_erasures --apply    # delete
