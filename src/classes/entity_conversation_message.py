    """
        One message of a conversation, in either direction: the history of ADR-0017. It is what a contact's export
        carries, what goes with the contact when it is deleted, and what tells a message Meta sent again from a new
        one.

        The chatbot, the direction and Meta's identifier together are the primary key, not a separate unique index:
        MongoDB always enforces the primary key, while an index disappears with the collection and is only created
        again when the service restarts. Meta sends a WhatsApp message again for up to 7 days.

        Who wrote is the contact's uuid, never the number nor the Messenger id. The text is stored encrypted with the
        client's data key; of an attachment, only its type: Meta's address expires and can carry the contact's data.
